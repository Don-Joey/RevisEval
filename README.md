**REVISE-AND-EVALUATION (RevisEval)** is a novel text generation evaluation paradigm via the response-adapted reference. RevisEval is driven by the key observation that an ideal reference should maintain the necessary relevance to the response to be evaluated. Specifically, REVISEVAL leverages the text revision capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to adaptively revise the response, then treat the revised text as the reference (response-adapted reference) for the subsequent evaluation.

## 📘 Overview

<!-- Add 1-3 key diagrams or tables summarizing your project -->

<img src="figs/table1.png"/> 

<p align="center"><b>Table 1:</b> Kendall (τ) and Spearman (ρ) correlation results comparing reference-free, reference-based, and RevisEval methods across natural language generation tasks. This table demonstrates that, without human-annotated references, our proposed RevisEval substantially outperforms referencefree and reference-based methods involving both open-source and proprietary LLM-as-a-Judge.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Table 2:</b> Accuracy of LLM-as-a-Judge on instruction-following preference tasks. Our proposed RevisEval considerably enhances the performance of both open-source and proprietary LLM-as-a-Judge across various general evaluation tasks. Here, D.R. denotes Direct Response to instruction.</p>

RevisEval greatly enhance traditional ref-based metrics, even achieving them comparable to GPT-4-as-a-Judge.</p>

## 🚀 How to Use

### 📦 Installation

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project folder:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Don-Joey/RevisEval.git
cd RevisEval
```

2. Create the environment and install dependencies:
   
```bash
conda create -n revisevavl python=3.10 -y
conda activate revisevavl
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### ⚡ Quick Start

Evaluate **RevisEval** on the RewardBench.

```bash
## Our generated crowd judgments are in ``results/rewardbench_mtbench_PoolModified_gpt-4o.json''
## You should fill your api-key.
run MAIN.ipynb
```

In main.ipynb, we provide the *criticizing selection/outcome removal part*, *crowd-judgment as context in prompt part*, and *evaluating CCE part*.

### 🔍 Whole Pipeline

1. **Generate Crowd-Responses**: At this stage, you can use any LLM of your choice to generate the corresponding crowd responses for the prompts in the benchmark.
    
2. **Generate Crowd-Judgments**: At this stage,

```bash
## if you want to compare crowd response to response B,
python main.py [benchmarkname: e.g.,rewardbench] [judgd prompt, e.g.,mtbench] [crowd judgment model name: e.g.,qwen-2.5-3b-instruct],default [base judge model: e.g.,gpt-4o] False True False

## if you want to compare crowd response to response A,
python main.py [benchmarkname: e.g.,rewardbench] [judgd prompt, e.g.,mtbench] default,[crowd judgment model name: e.g.,qwen-2.5-3b-instruct] [base judge model: e.g.,gpt-4o] False True False
```

## 📌 Coming Soon

- [ ] Support for whole pipeline generation
- [ ] Compare to other test-time scaling for LLM-as-a-Judge/Generative RM.
